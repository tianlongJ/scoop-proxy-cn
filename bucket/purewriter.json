    "- Pure Writer Desktop 1.4.0 version must be used with Pure Writer 19.92.0 or above.",

    "- During the development of this desktop version, I have encountered some situations that will cause the current article on Pure Writer Android to be emptied. Although this problem has been fixed, I am not completely sure if some scenes may trigger this again. But don't worry, because Pure Writer for Android supports multiple Backups. You can recoverrestore it by using 'History' or 'Undo'. More about automatic backup and cloud backup: <https:writer.drakeet.combackups>"
